This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [GoCyclo](https://github.com/fzipp/gocyclo) support.

## Requirements

* Go
* Java 8+

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
docker run -it -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/src codacy/codacy-metrics-gocyclo:latest
```

## Test

Before running the tests, you need to setup the go environment
and add the binaries localtion to your path:

```bash
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

Then you can install GoCyclo:

```bash
go get github.com/fzipp/gocyclo
```

After that, you can run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```
