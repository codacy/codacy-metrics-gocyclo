This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [GoCyclo](https://github.com/fzipp/gocyclo) support.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
docker run -it -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/src codacy/codacy-metrics-gocyclo:latest
```

## Test

Before running the tests, you need to install gocyclo:

```bash
apt-get install golang -y
go get github.com/fzipp/gocyclo
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

After that, you can run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test
```
